# AlgorithmPractise

This repository is for practising Test-Driven-Development while solving random leetcode tasks. The resulting algorithms may not come out with the best performance but are always thoroughly tested and proven to be working.

My goals with this repository is to build better habits while developing software. I want to make smaller commits, therefore commiting more often. I also want to build the habit to run tests more often, idealy after every change. I want to build the habits to write the test during a feature's development and not afterwards in order to have more meaningful tests as well as a better coverage of edge cases.
